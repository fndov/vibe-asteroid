The game should feature a main menu with multiple entries, including:

  * **Settings**

  Inside the **Settings** menu:

  1. **Starting Upgrades**

     * When selected, this opens a sub-menu.
     * The screen layout:

       * **Left side:** A list of available starting upgrades you can toggle or adjust
       * **Right side:** A live preview of your ship showing the changes as you adjust settings. (right now I don't expect upgrades
  to change how the ship looks but show anyways)

  2. **Ship Style**

     * When selected, this opens another sub-menu.
     * The screen layout:

       * **Left side:** Color customization options for your ship (e.g. color pickers, preset palettes, or RGB sliders).
       * **Right side:** A live preview of your ship with the selected color applied. so now that you know the plan go forward with it after making the plan.md file
